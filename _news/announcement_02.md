Check out another one of my new websites: [SurvivorDK.com](https://survivordk.com/)

I started a gaming YouTube channel [@SurvivorDK](https://www.youtube.com/@SurvivorDK) in 2023 because I enjoy PC gaming and I wanted to learn video editing. There was a lot for me to learn, from recording with OBS, to fixing my audio in Audacity, to finding royalty-free-music, to editing in OpenShot and KDenLive, to actually playing the game and making progress! Iâ€™ve really enjoyed every step of the way though!!

I play Ark: Survival Evolved solo on Ragnarok. Ark is an action-adventure, open-world, survival, crafting game where you can tame dinos, build bases, and fight bosses.
