Here are some pictures that I took in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding cities and rivers.

## Nampa, Caldwell, Meridian, and Boise

The Nampa water tower was taken down Friday, January 19, 2024.  I regularly commuted past the tower on I-84.  I was happy that I had taken this picture of the tower while it was still standing.  They are building a new water tower in it's place that is expected to be completed in Spring of 2025.  You can read more about it here:
